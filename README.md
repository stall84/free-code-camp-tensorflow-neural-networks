# Free Code Camp's Tensorflow - Python Neural Networks Tutorial

- Thank you for the tutorial and resources! The entire course can be found on youtube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPYj3fFJGjk&t=402s
- Unless noted, all notes are <a href="https://www.github.com/stall84">my</a> own from the material presented in the tutorial.
- The first note to the notes is that I might rely on notes previously taken or copied in my <a href="https://github.com/stall84/machine-learning-basics-notes.git">Machine Learning Basics</a> repository, itself being compiled from free sources published on the internet (mostly youtube). The README in that repo has credits.
- Thank you to all whom I may cite or quote. If you own some visual or other piece of IP that might make it into any of my learning-repositories like this one, and you would like it removed, please contact me.
