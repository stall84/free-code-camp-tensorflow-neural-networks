## Core Machine Learning Algorithms (with TensorFlow)

_note: without going into too much detail on the algorithms we've already noted and practiced in [other course-repositories](https://github.com/stall84/ml-basics-exercises-notes/tree/main/notes) and dedicating more time to those that are newer to us._

- **Linear Regression:** See previous [notes here](https://github.com/stall84/ml-basics-exercises-notes/blob/main/notes/6-simple-linear-regresion.md)

- **Classification**

- **Clustering**

- **Hidden Markov Models**
